## üéØ Usage Examples

### Natural Language Interaction
```csharp
// Ask the agent to research a topic
"Research mean reversion strategies from recent ArXiv papers"

// Get sentiment analysis
"Analyze current market sentiment for Bitcoin and Ethereum"

"Find statistical patterns in AAPL over the last week"

// Compare assets
"Compare sentiment across crypto, stocks, and bonds"
```

### Integrated Workflow
1. **Academic Research**: "What are the latest academic strategies for portfolio optimization?"
2. **Sentiment Check**: "What's the current market sentiment for implementing this strategy?"
3. **Pattern Validation**: "Are there statistical patterns that support this approach?"
4. **Implementation**: "Generate an implementation roadmap for this strategy"

## üéâ Result

Your Semantic Kernel C# quantitative research system now has **three powerful research agents** that can:

1. **Extract trading strategies from academic research**
2. **Analyze market sentiment from multiple sources** 
3. **Detect and analyze statistical patterns in market data**

Each agent provides:
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive analysis capabilities
- ‚úÖ Natural language interfaces via Semantic Kernel
- ‚úÖ Historical tracking and trend analysis  
- ‚úÖ Implementation guidance and risk assessment
- ‚úÖ Integration with your existing trading system

The system maintains the same architecture and patterns as your original implementation while significantly expanding the research and analysis capabilities. All agents work together seamlessly and can be used independently or in combination for comprehensive market analysis.
